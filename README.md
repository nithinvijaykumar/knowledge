# Knowledge Nuggets
## A system to capture knowledge in the manufacturing workplace and reward contributors

The Knowledge Nuggets system is designed to maximize the productivity of people in a manufacturing facility.

### Target User and Problem Definition

The target user persona is someone who steps into a manufacturing facility that they haven't visited before. He/she is looking to accomplish some task or project, and needs to use the equipment available to complete their task. Being new at the site, they are immediately presented with a few challenges:

1. They are not familiar with the layout of the facility, intended purpose of each workspace and tools available at each workspace
2. They don't know where to find specific pieces of equipment, accessories and related resources needed to complete their project
3. They may not know how to use the available equipment from a functional perspective
4. They may not be familiar with how to safely operate the equipment and mitigate situations if something goes wrong

### Solution Overview

The Knowledge Nuggets system acts as a helpful guide that assists the user in addressing the above challenges. The system attempts to capture the experience of people who already know how to be productive with the environment/tools and provide orientation and guidance to help them accomplish their tasks. Beyond the completion of the immediate task, the system also provides opportunities and incentives to gain proficiency and become certified, and thereby unlock rewards and additional access.
